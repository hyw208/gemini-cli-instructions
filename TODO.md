# TODO

- [x] fix copilot instruction to use module instead of python file path

- [x] need to find out how to use relative path for python executable instead of full path

- [x] gemini told me it can only look at it's current project directory not ~/.gemini/commands, need to follow copilot approach to symlink to current folder...
